      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <h3>I was born and raise in Harlem, NY I my name is Mark Farrell. I'm African American and half Trini. Developed an eye for fashion during my freshmen year in high school during my career in high school I completed an three week per-college summer course at F.I.T for Fashion Design. Not stop there I also went into personal styling helping others bring an new look or just want to spices up their wardrobe.</h1>
      <p>Growing up in Harlem to me is a blessing. I was born into a place that history runs deep from the Harlem Renaissance to having famous buildings like the Apollo and the Cotton Club. Having great places to eat like Mamma and Amy Ruth's as well being the birth place of the beacon egg and cheese and chop cheese. Harlem is also known for having an unique fashion sense and were a lot of trends starts.</p>
